### Packore Packaging: Customer & Product Profitability Analysis (2016–2020)
A data-driven business intelligence project analyzing customer profitability, product margins, and servicing cost breakdowns at a fictional packaging company. This case study was inspired by a classroom scenario and recreated independently for educational and portfolio purposes.

It uses Tableau and Excel to simulate how aggressive account growth can affect operational efficiency and long-term profit margins, and offers strategic recommendations based on Customer-Based Accounting (CBA) insights.

#### Key Highlights
Revenue increased by 119% under new leadership, but profit margins fell from 7.1% to 5.0%

Over 60% of customers were classified as unprofitable “Draggers” or marginal “Niche” accounts

The 10 most profitable customers contributed just 3.7% of total profit

Bottom 10 customers alone accounted for $1.1M in losses

Design and query support services represented 73% of total service costs

#### Tools Used

Tableau Public (Dashboard design & visualization)

Excel (Data wrangling & analysis)

Notion (Case write-up & storytelling)
